        "* Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The project focuses on predicting credit scores using a multiclass classification approach, leveraging a dataset of 150,000 records and 28 features.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The dataset is already divided into training and testing sets, and the analysis adheres to the data science lifecycle. The primary goal is to explore the data, preprocess it, engineer meaningful features, and build a robust predictive model to categorize individuals based on their credit scores effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The project also aims to derive actionable insights into factors influencing credit scores, ensuring the model's practical relevance and interpretability."
